Bubble Sort in Java Swing

This project implements a visualization of the bubble sort algorithm using the Java Swing graphical user interface. Users input numerical data separated by commas, and then they can observe the animation of the bubble sort process.

How to Run the Project:
- Compile the source code using a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ or Eclipse, or from the command line.
- Run the application, and a window with a graphical interface will appear.

User Instructions:
- Enter numbers to be sorted, separating them with commas (e.g., 5,2,8,1,4).
- Click the "Sort" button to see the bubble sort animation.
- Click the "Reset" button to clear the data and restore the view to the initial state.
